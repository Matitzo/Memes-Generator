# Memes-Generator

The meme generator is my first project using React.js. It was created as part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

The meme generator, as the name suggests, allows the user to create a meme. It requires the user to enter any two texts into a randomly generated picture. The first will be placed at the top of the image, while the second will appear as a punchline at the bottom of the image.
